## About

> I am a student interested in development of android and web apps.

I always knew I liked puzzles and problem solving, but it was only in first year into my engineering that I realized I *love* coding. Since then, I've been learning constantly. First, I was charmed by Python and OOP. Shortly afterwards, I delved into optimizing search algorithms in C++, only to then spend an unexpected vacation into competitive coding.

Before I started working, I had dismissed web development, scared away by unorderly chunks of HTML I had glimpsed now and again.

**But then there was <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">React</a>.** The ease with which reusable components can be composed into beautiful websites, with predictable state management, had me hooked. Since then, the spare time left to me after work and choir practice is spent with JavaScript. And while that is good and all, it is coupled with a healthy dose of fullstack development during work hours.

In both contexts, I strive to achieve automation. I want development, as well as life in general, to be *smooth*, and I am determined to find (or write) the applications that will take me there.
